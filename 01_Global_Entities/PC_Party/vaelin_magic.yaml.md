# Vaelin's Grimoire & Magic

> [!SYSTEM DIRECTIVE]
> **For the AI Dungeon Master:** This file represents the "Arcane Arsenal" domain. It contains Vaelin's known spells, spell-like invocations, and his current magical resources.
>
> **When to reference this file:**
> * **Spellcasting:** Whenever Vaelin declares he is casting a spell or using a magical invocation. Reference the specific `casting_time`, `range`, `duration`, and `cost` keys to properly resolve the mechanics.
> * **Saving Throws:** To find Vaelin's `save_dc` (13) when an enemy is forced to resist one of his spells (e.g., Create Bonfire).
> * **Resource Verification:** To ensure Vaelin has the available `pact_slots` or `sorcerer_level_X` slots required to cast a leveled spell. `pact_slot_level` indicates the power level at which Pact slots are currently cast.
